# MouseHunt - Useful Userscripts

## What is a userscript and why should I care?

A userscript is a piece of JavaScript code that modifies certain elements or behaviors on a web page.

For MouseHunt, userscripts add quality of life features & improvements to the overall gameplay experience. The scripts below have been reviewed to make sure they're not in violation of ToS, but do keep in mind that they aren't officially sanctioned. (A few have received praise from the devs before though ðŸ¤©)

## How to install

Download [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/), a popular userscript manager with support for all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, Opera).

Navigate to a script's GreasyFork page, click 'Install this script' and then 'Install'. Refresh your MouseHunt page and you should be set!

Most scripts will work on both mousehuntgame.com and apps.facebook.com.

**Note:** Most (if not all) of the userscripts listed below **are not** tested on Greasemonkey and Violentmonkey. If you are having unexpected bugs/issues, consider switching to Tampermonkey before reporting them.
